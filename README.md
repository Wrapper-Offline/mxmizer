# mxmizer
**mxmizer** is a program designed to convert MXML documents decompiled to AS using [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) back into their original format.
The intended use case for this project is to decompile GoAnimate applications, though it should be able to be applied to other things, so long as it was made in Apache/Adobe Flex.
